## A collection of tech projects

### SSN web app, 2018-2019

I was part of the Techladies bootcamp, to create a live web application for Singapore Sustanability Network to aggregate . See our project demo [here](https://www.facebook.com/ssnsingapore/videos/293450054683330/). Our project was a full-stack project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, NodeJS).
