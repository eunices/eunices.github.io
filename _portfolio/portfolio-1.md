## A collection of tech projects

### SSN web app, 2018-2019

I was part of the Techladies bootcamp, to create a live web application for Singapore Sustanability Network to aggregate environmental NGOs in Singapore. See our project demo [here](https://www.facebook.com/ssnsingapore/videos/293450054683330/). Ours was a fullstack project using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js, NodeJS) and Material UI, and deployed using Heroku/github.

I learnt how to write code from web services to frontend which utilised the former. Also learnt unit testing and heroku pipeline for continuous delivery.

### Surbana Jurong lift predictive maintenance end-to-end POC, 2018-2019

I was part of the AI Apprentice programme at NUS SCALE. Worked in a multidisciplinary team to create an end-to-end POC deliverable for a predictive maintenanace model for lifts. Project included elements of data engineering, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data modelling/ model management, backend web services and scheduled jobs. 

I developed scripts in python pertaining to the exploratory data analysis, data modelling/ model management, and gained rudimentary knowledge on data engineering. I also learnt good software engineering practices such as Agile and code versioning, and writing technical documentation based on requirements.

### Course on mobile programming, 2019-2020

I took up the Specialist Diploma on Mobile Application Programming at Singapore Polytechnic. We learnt about web services (using Java) and basics of Android Studio over a year. Made a Money Transfer POC app in each case.

### Small projects


#### Fitbit Ionic Clock Face

Made this because there were few clock faces that were pretty and had the necessary stats. that I wanted on the watch (heart rate, distance, steps, time w/ seconds, date and day).
