## A collection of tech projects

### SSN web app, 2018-2019

I was part of the Techladies bootcamp, to create a live web application for Singapore Sustanability Network to aggregate . See our project demo [here](https://www.facebook.com/ssnsingapore/videos/293450054683330/). Our project was a full-stack project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, NodeJS) and Material UI.

I learnt how to write scripts for web services that were consumed by the frontend.

### Surbana Jurong lift predictive maintenance end-to-end POC, 2018-2019

I was part of the AI Apprentice programme at NUS SCALE. Worked in a multidisciplinary team to create an end-to-end POC deliverable for a predictive maintenace model for lifts. Project included elements of data engineering, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data modelling/ model management, backend web services and scheduled jobs. 

I helped developed scripts in python pertaining to the exploratory data analysis, data modelling/ model management, and gained rudimentary knowledge on data engineering.
