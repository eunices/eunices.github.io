## Research journey

### the undergrad years

In my second year, I was given an opportunity to work on an ant diversity project under (then PhD student) Dr Chua Siew Chin. That project challenged me in many ways - DIY Winkler extractors, sorting samples, learning ant generic identification, data analyses. 

In my third year, I went to University of Toronto for an exchange programme focused on Environmental Biology. There I had the chance to learn about participate in a field camp at Harkness research station, learn about community ecology as well as python programming and GIS from the renowned Computer Science and GIS departments at the university.

In my fourth year, I conducted my FYP thesis under Dr John Ascher on the diversity of Megachile in Singapore, as the fauna was not so well known then. Through that, we and our collaborators published the checklist of Megachile in Singapore, as well as a report on Anthidinii in Singapore. 

I've had the privilege to go on field courses such as the Ant Course 2012, Tioman field course 2014 and Operation Wallacea to Honduras in 2013.

My main takeaway from my undergrad days were species ID for Megachilidae in Singapore, ant generic identification and data analysis.

### the post-graduation years

I decided to work for a couple years upon graduation... I worked at the EHI NEA as a researcher, A*STAR as a data administrator, then at SCDF as an analyst, before stopping at AI Singapore as an AI apprentice. More details can be found on my CV/LinkedIn page.

Through these work experiences, I realised that data is useful tool for informing decision making and was hoping to go back to school to pick up more skills in data modelling and data/software engineering...

My main takeaway were conducting mosquito field studies, data pipelines and leveraging on ML/AI technologies. I had the chance to brush up on programming and software engineering related skills.

### back to postgrad MSc studies

I'm now back in A/P Roman Carrasco's (cosupervised by Dr John Ascher) lab exploring trends in bee macroecology. I hope to collaborate with others on other projects as well~. Will update again later on this!
