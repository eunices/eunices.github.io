In general, these are the skills I've picked up during my time during research. See [My ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eunice_Soh2/research) for more information.

For undergraduate days, this includes 1) Mapping and analyses using Geographical Information Systems [GIS], 2) Generic identification of ants in Asia, 3) Species identification of *Megachile* in Singapore. 

For my MSc, [to be updated]

## Undergraduate research themes

### Mapping and analyses (Geographical Information Systems [GIS])

- One undergraduate project:
  1. [Spatial Distribution of Javan mynas in Singapore](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277554540_Spatial_Distribution_of_Javan_mynas_in_Singapore)
- [Mini mapping projects](https://eunice.carbonmade.com/projects/4842799)

### Natural history of bees and ants

#### Generic identification of ants in Asia

- Two undergraduate projects:
    1. [Ant Diversity in Urban Matrices of Kent Ridge](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277554411_Ant_Diversity_in_Urban_Matrices_of_Kent_Ridge)
    2. [Assessing Ant Functional Groups in Primary and Secondary Forests](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277554429_Assessing_Ant_Functional_Groups_in_Primary_and_Secondary_Forests)

#### Species identification and natural history of *Megachile* in Singapore

- One undergraduate project:
  1. [Diversity and trap-nesting studies of Singaporean *Megachile* bees to inform monitoring and management of tropical pollinators](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277554477_Diversity_and_trap-nesting_studies_of_Singaporean_Megachile_bees_to_inform_monitoring_and_management_of_tropical_pollinators)
