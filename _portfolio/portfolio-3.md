In general, these are the skills I've picked up during my time doing research. See [my ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eunice_Soh2/research) for more publication/ report outputs.

While doing my undergraduate studies, research included 1) mapping and analyses using Geographical Information Systems [GIS], 2) community ecology and generic identification of ants in Asia, 3) natural history and species identification of *Megachile* in Singapore ([see below](#undergraduate-research)).

For MSc, I focus mainly on cleaning complex data and analysing data using statistical methods ([see below](#masters-research)) and am supervised by Assoc Prof Roman Carrasco (main supervisor) and Asst Prof John Ascher. I also did coursework on Theoretical Biology (by Assoc Prof Ryan Chisholm and Assoc Prof Timothy Saunders) as well as Population Genomics and Phylogenomics (by Assoc Prof Frank Rheindt), while auditing a course on Linear Algebra by the Department of Mathematics. 

## Undergraduate research

### Mapping and analyses (Geographical Information Systems [GIS])

- One undergraduate project:
  1. [Spatial Distribution of Javan mynas in Singapore](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277554540_Spatial_Distribution_of_Javan_mynas_in_Singapore)
- [Mini mapping projects](https://eunice.carbonmade.com/projects/4842799)


### Community ecology and generic identification of ants in Asia

- Two undergraduate projects:
    1. [Ant Diversity in Urban Matrices of Kent Ridge](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277554411_Ant_Diversity_in_Urban_Matrices_of_Kent_Ridge)
    2. [Assessing Ant Functional Groups in Primary and Secondary Forests](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277554429_Assessing_Ant_Functional_Groups_in_Primary_and_Secondary_Forests)

### Natural history and species identification of *Megachile* in Singapore

- One undergraduate project:
  1. [Diversity and trap-nesting studies of Singaporean *Megachile* bees to inform monitoring and management of tropical pollinators](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277554477_Diversity_and_trap-nesting_studies_of_Singaporean_Megachile_bees_to_inform_monitoring_and_management_of_tropical_pollinators)

## Masters research

### Data analysis skills

- Network analysis applied to
  - Modularity in coauthorship networks across countries
  - Specialist/ generalist relationships, guilds in bee-pollinator networks


- Utilising and modifying code from existing papers
  - Fitting density-dependent curves, to estimate year of gender parity for bee describers ([Holman et al. 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004956))
  - Bayesian analyses with stan, to predict number of bee species to be described ([Edie et al. 2017](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/14/3666))

- Flows of resources from one country to another using GLM/ logistic regression
